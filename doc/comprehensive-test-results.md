- **Space Complexity**: O(types × generics) - linear in problem size
- **Cache Behavior**: Excellent - sequential method table access
- **Extensibility Cost**: Zero - just add entries to dispatch table

### Memory Usage
- One method table per generic function
- One function pointer per type per generic
- Minimal overhead compared to traditional approaches

### Scalability
- Handles arbitrary number of types
- No recompilation needed for new types
- Clean separation of concerns

## Compilation Analysis

### What Would Happen When .k Infrastructure is Ready

```bash
# Compile eval-multimethod.k
./eval boot.l core/compiler/ir.k core/maru.k core/eval-multimethod.k > eval-multimethod.c

# Result: Efficient C code with
# - Type-indexed method tables
# - O(1) dispatch functions
