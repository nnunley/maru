# Your rule content

- Always look at [boot.l](mdc:boot.l), [boot2.l](mdc:boot2.l), [eval.l](mdc:eval.l), [emit.l](mdc:emit.l) for better context on the language
- This system uses nested grammars. The bottom-most grammar is an object oriented lisp variant, with multi-methods
- It is intended to be able to generate its own native code by generating code in a target language (c, assembly)
