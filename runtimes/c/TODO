- fix lost signal bug (see star demo in gezira)
- get it to work with multiple threads
- make ready_q stuff to avoid using the semaphore.
- make nile_Kernel_exec aware of the shutdown flag.
- rename certain parts to match OS terminology (e.g., OS process state names)
- rename nile_feed to nile_send ?
- get rid of nile_Interleave__clone
- port to Linux and Windows
- nile.c should be using nile_Real_... operations in some places
- align the incoming memory to 32-bits (to ensure atomic ops)?
- use binary semaphores (Events on Win32?) instead of
  counting semaphores, since we can count ourselves and just
  need a sleep/wakup mechanism
- keep a reference to nl in kernels so that we don't have to
  pass around nl so much.
- on uniprocessors, we should make nile_pause relinquish the processor?
- optimize SortBy for when the input stream is wholly contained
  in the first input buffer. Do an in-place sort and
  just forward the modified input buffer downstream
- rename "initialized" field to something related to first_time
  or prologue or something?
- what if they give us an input buffer that isn't a multiple of in_quantum?
  (obviously by mistake)
- handle the limit on number of kernels that can be pipelined.
  we just have to split them up into multiple pipelines, not too hard?
- should pipeline kernels even be n-ary?
