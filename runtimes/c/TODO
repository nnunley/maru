- port to Linux and Windows

- rethink naming:
    - nile_main processes kernels
    - nile_Kernel_exec processes stream buffers
    - k->process (of type nile_Kernel_process_t) processes stream elements

- store an nl var in the kernel (and buffer?) struct
- make nile_Kernel_exec aware of the shutdown flag?
- rename certain parts to match OS terminology (e.g., OS process state names)?
- rename nile_feed to nile_send ?
- nile.c should be using nile_Real_... operations in some places
- align the incoming memory to 32-bits (to ensure atomic ops)?
  or refuse memory that isn't aligned?
- on uniprocessors, we should make nile_pause relinquish the processor?
  what other things should we be avoiding/skipping on uniprocessors?
  make things work even for nthreads = 0?
- optimize SortBy for when the input stream is wholly contained
  in the first input buffer. Do an in-place sort and
  just forward the modified input buffer downstream
  Does this matter?
- rename "initialized" field to something related to first_time
  or prologue or something?
- what if they give us an input buffer that isn't a multiple of in_quantum?
  (obviously by mistake)
- handle the limit on number of kernels that can be pipelined.
  we just have to split them up into multiple pipelines, not too hard?
- should pipeline kernels even be n-ary?
