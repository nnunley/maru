# Port Streams TODO Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully resolved the "port streams." TODO item (line 140 in TODO file) by fixing and integrating the existing port stream functionality.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Console Port Display Bug
**Problem**: The `do-print` method in port.l was calling `array-length` on console port buffers, which are `()` (empty list) rather than arrays.

**Fix**: Updated `do-print` method to handle both string ports (with array buffers) and console ports (with empty buffers):
```lisp
(define-method do-print <port> () 
  (print "<port " 
         (if self.buffer (array-length self.buffer) "console")
         ":" self.column ">"))
```

### 2. Pretty-Print Path Issue
**Problem**: `pretty-print.l` was using `(require "port.l")` but couldn't find the correct path.

**Fix**: Updated to use correct relative path:
```lisp
(require "lib/stream/port.l")
```

### 3. Repl Integration
**Problem**: Port.l was commented out in `repl.l`, preventing port streams from being available in the REPL environment.

**Fix**: Enabled port.l loading in repl.l:
```lisp
(load "lib/stream/port.l")
(load "lib/pretty-print.l")
```

Also fixed related path issues for core files:
```lisp
(load "core/parser.l")
(load "core/peg-compile.l") 
(load "core/peg.l")
```

## Port Stream Features Now Working

### ✅ Basic Port Operations
- `<port>` structure with buffer and column tracking
- `string-port()` - creates buffered string output port
- `console-port()` - creates console output port  
- `port-contents(port)` - retrieves buffer contents as string

### ✅ Port Writing Methods
- `port-put(port, char)` - write single character
- `port-write(port, ...seqs)` - write multiple sequences
- `port-write-seq(port, seq)` - write single sequence
- `port-newline(port)` - add newline if needed
- `port-indent(port, col)` - add spaces for indentation
- `port-newline-indent(port, col)` - newline + indentation

### ✅ Pretty-Print Integration
- `pretty-print(obj)` - pretty print to console using port system
- `pretty-string(obj)` - pretty print to string using string port
- Full integration with Maru's object system and method dispatch

### ✅ Type System Integration
- `->string` methods for basic types (string, symbol, long, double)
- Proper method dispatch for port operations
- Object printing with port-based display methods

## Testing Results

All port stream functionality verified working:

```
=== PORT STREAMS INTEGRATION TEST ===
✅ Port structure <port> working
✅ string-port() function working  
✅ console-port() function working
✅ port-write method working
✅ port-contents function working
✅ port-newline method working
✅ port-indent method working
✅ Integration with pretty-print.l working
✅ pretty-string function working
✅ Console port output working
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/stream/port.l`** - Fixed console port display bug
2. **`lib/pretty-print.l`** - Fixed require path for port.l
3. **`lib/repl.l`** - Enabled port.l loading and fixed core file paths

## Files Created for Testing

1. **`test-port-integration.l`** - Basic port functionality tests
2. **`test-repl-with-ports.l`** - REPL integration tests  
3. **`test-port-streams-complete.l`** - Comprehensive test suite

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The "port streams." TODO item is now fully resolved. Port streams are:
- ✅ Fixed and working correctly
- ✅ Integrated with the pretty-print system
- ✅ Available in the REPL environment
- ✅ Tested comprehensively
- ✅ Ready for use throughout the Maru system

The port stream infrastructure provides a solid foundation for formatted output and can be extended for additional I/O operations as needed.
