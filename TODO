- rethink all the syntax
- rethink tuple type naming syntax
- think about syntax like 2b + 0.5c
    - introduce a math mode? (single letter variables, etc.?)
      perhaps only in the body of âˆ€ blocks?
- get rid of tuple reduction?
- introduce _ vars back into the language?
- support what's needed for png.nl and zlib.nl
    - binary data processing
    - other kernel control
    - user-defined, primitive operation
- write tests
- debuggers?
- write cola compiler
- write simple stand-alone examples
    - pike's prime sieve
    - see stream processing examples in other languages/academic papers/streamit
      etc.
- write documentation
    - update PDF doc
    - document the kernel clone rules (when a kernel is referenced more that
      once in a pipeline expression)
    - document that kernel parameters are immutable
- fix font problem on windows (add missing chars to DejaVu Sans Mono and/or Inconsolata)
