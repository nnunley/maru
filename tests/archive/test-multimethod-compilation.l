(println "   - Generic functions maintain method tables indexed by type")
(println "   - Methods are registered during initialization")

(println "\n4. Benefits Over Switch-Based Dispatch:")
(println "   - Clean separation: each type's methods are grouped together")
(println "   - Open for extension: add new types without modifying dispatcher")
(println "   - Better code organization: methods near their type definitions")
(println "   - Follows single responsibility principle")

(println "\n6. Memory Layout in Generated Code:")
(println "   - Each maru_value has a type tag")
