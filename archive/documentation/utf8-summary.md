# UTF-8 Implementation for Maru - Summary

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created Native UTF-8 Support Files**:
   - `utf8.c` - C implementation with `maru_` prefixed functions
   - `utf8.k` - Maru IR2 typed implementation  
   - `maru-utf8.k` - Pure Maru Lisp implementation

2. **Added Generated File Headers**:
   - Modified `ir-gen-c.k` to add "GENERATED CODE - DO NOT EDIT" headers
   - Modified `compile-peg.l` to add headers to grammar-generated files

3. **Implemented Key UTF-8 Functions**:
   - `utf8-char-length` - Get byte length of UTF-8 character
   - `utf8-strlen` - Count characters (not bytes) in UTF-8 string
   - `utf8-decode-at` - Decode UTF-8 character at position
   - `utf8-char-at` - Get nth character from UTF-8 string
   - `utf8-script` - Detect Unicode script (Latin, CJK, Arabic, etc.)
   - `utf8-direction` - Detect text direction (LTR/RTL)
   - `utf8-compare` - Compare UTF-8 strings
   - `utf8-collation-weight` - Get collation weight for sorting

4. **Unicode Support**:
   - Handles ASCII, Latin-1, CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Emoji
   - Proper character counting vs byte counting
   - Script detection for internationalization
   - Bidirectional text awareness

5. **Testing**:
   - Created validation tests comparing against Unicode standards
   - Demonstrated correct character counting for multibyte strings
   - Showed proper handling of various scripts and languages

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pure UTF-8**: No UTF-32 intermediate representation for space efficiency
2. **Maru Native**: Used Maru's own language features rather than external C
3. **Prefix Functions**: All C functions prefixed with `maru_` to avoid conflicts
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Used only what's available in Maru's runtime

## Integration with Maru

The UTF-8 functions can be used in Maru code by:
1. Including the appropriate file (`utf8.k` for IR2 or `maru-utf8.k` for Lisp)
2. Using the functions directly in Maru code
3. The implementation properly handles UTF-8 encoded strings

## Example Usage

```lisp
;; Count characters in UTF-8 string
(utf8-strlen "Hello")     ; => 5
(utf8-strlen "café")      ; => 4 (if properly UTF-8 encoded)
(utf8-strlen "你好")      ; => 2
(utf8-strlen "🌍🌎🌏")   ; => 3

;; Get character at index
(utf8-char-at "Hello" 1)  ; => 101 (ASCII 'e')

;; Detect script
(utf8-script 65)          ; => 'latin
(utf8-script 20013)       ; => 'cjk
(utf8-script 1488)        ; => 'hebrew
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Full Unicode normalization (NFD, NFC, NFKD, NFKC)
2. Locale-specific collation rules
3. Grapheme cluster support
4. Case folding and transformations
5. Integration with Maru's string functions

The implementation provides a solid foundation for UTF-8 support in Maru, enabling proper handling of international text while maintaining compatibility with existing code through the wchar_t compatibility layer.
