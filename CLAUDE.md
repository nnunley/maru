- **Metacircular Discovery**: Used Maru's introspection to find all existing capabilities

### Known Issues & TODOs

1. **Directory Structure**: Project has grown organically resulting in:
   - 742+ files with unclear organization
   - Root directory cluttered with 50+ experimental files
   - 33 emit-* variants representing different experiments
   - Important documentation scattered across directories

2. **File Proliferation**: Multiple versions of core files need consolidation
   - emit-c-threaded-*.l variants need organization
   - eval-related experiments scattered throughout
   - Test files mixed with source files

3. **Build System**: Makefile needs updates for new features and better organization

## Core System Architecture

### The Metacircular Compiler Loop

A metacircular compiler is a self-hosting compiler written in the language it compiles. Maru achieves this through a carefully orchestrated bootstrap process that progressively builds more sophisticated versions of itself.

### Bootstrap Process Overview

```
1. Initial C evaluator (eval) reads boot.l
2. boot.l defines core language constructs
3. emit.l loaded to enable code generation
4. System can now compile itself
5. Additional features loaded (eval.l, buffer.l, etc.)
```

### Key Files and Their Roles

#### Core Bootstrap Files
- **`boot.l`**: Core language definitions (forms, functions, structures)
- **`emit.l`**: Code generation to C (multiple backends in development)
- **`eval.l`**: Lisp evaluator implementation
- **`eval.k`**: Compiled version of evaluator

#### Generated Files (DO NOT EDIT)
- **`eval.c`**, **`eval2.c`**: Generated C evaluators
- **`buffer.c`**, **`gc.c`**: Generated support code
- **`osdefs.c`**: Generated OS definitions

#### Recent Feature Additions
- **Port Streams**: `lib/stream/port.l` - I/O abstraction layer
- **Pretty Printing**: `lib/pretty-print.l` - Formatted output
- **PEG Enhancements**: `peg-ir-compiler.l`, `peg-grammar-environments.l`
- **Dotted Access**: `dotted-access-working.l` - Environment access syntax
- **JIT Infrastructure**: `lib/dlopen.k` FFI system discovered and verified working

## Development Guidelines

### Key Practices

1. **Never modify generated C files** - They are build artifacts
2. **Use version control** for experiments instead of creating new files
3. **Follow existing patterns** when adding features
4. **Test thoroughly** - Bootstrap process is fragile
5. **Document changes** in this file and feature-specific docs

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Standard build
make clean && make

# Test bootstrap
./eval boot.l

# Run tests
make test

# Cross-platform build
MARU_TARGET_ARCH=arm64 make
MARU_TARGET_ARCH=x86 make
```

### Adding New Features

1. Create feature branch in git
2. Develop in appropriate directory (lib/ for libraries, core/ for core features)
3. Test with bootstrap process
4. Update documentation
5. Ensure cross-platform compatibility

## Technical Deep Dives

### Port Streams Implementation

The port streams system provides a unified I/O abstraction:

```lisp
;; Create string port for buffered output
(define port (string-port))
(port-write port "Hello, ")
(port-write port "World!")
(port-contents port) ; → "Hello, World!"

;; Console port for direct output
(define console (console-port))
(port-write console "Direct to console")
```

Integration points:
- Pretty printer uses ports for all output
- REPL enhanced with port-based I/O
- Foundation for future I/O enhancements

### PEG IR Compiler Architecture

The PEG system now supports dynamic parser generation:

```lisp
;; Define grammar in IR form
(define grammar
  '((letter (match-class "letter"))
    (identifier (match-one-more (match-rule letter)))))

;; Instantiate parser immediately
(peg-instantiate-parser grammar '<my-parser>)
```

Key innovations:
- No intermediate file generation
- Runtime parser creation
- Full PEG operation support
- Backward compatible with existing system

### Dotted Environment Access

Solves grammar isolation problem:

```lisp
;; Each grammar has isolated environment
(define-peg-parser json-parser
  ((rule number (match-one-more (match-class digit)))
   (rule string (match-sequence (match-char #\") ...)))
  string)

;; No conflict with other grammars using same rule names
(define-peg-parser xml-parser
  ((rule string (match-sequence (match-char #\<) ...)))
  string)
```

Implementation details:
- Compile-time macro expansion
- Manual string parsing (Maru lacks some string functions)
- Environment structure with name/binding pairs
- Seamless integration with existing self.field syntax

### JIT Compilation System

Maru has complete JIT capabilities using existing infrastructure:

```lisp
;; JIT Architecture (proven feasible)
1. Load full system: eval.l + emit.l + (require "dlopen.k")
2. Generate ARM64/x86 assembly code
3. Compile: system("as...") + system("ld...") → dylib  
4. Load: dlopen() + dlsym() → function pointer
5. Bind: (subr symbol-name signature) → callable function
6. Execute: (function args...) at native speed
```

**Key Components**:
- **FFI System**: `lib/dlopen.k` - Complete foreign function interface
- **Assembly Backends**: `arch/arm64/*.l`, `arch/x86/*.l` - Code generation
- **Runtime Support**: `core/osdefs.k` - Platform constants (RTLD_NOW, etc.)
- **Real Examples**: `lib/libgl.k` - 97 OpenGL functions via dlopen

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Assembly generation: <1ms (immediate)
- External compilation: 25-42ms (as + ld measured)
- Direct Mach-O: 7-15ms (proposed enhancement)
- Library loading: 1-3ms (dlopen/dlsym)
- Function calls: <0.1ms (native speed)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use dlopen() approach (avoids macOS MAP_JIT restrictions)
- No entitlements required
- Leverages existing Maru FFI patterns
- Standard UNIX approach, works on all platforms

**Files Created**:
- `MARU-JIT-FEASIBILITY-COMPLETE.md` - Complete technical analysis
- `jit-working-complete.l` - Working proof-of-concept (requires full system)
- `mach-o-writer.l` - Direct Mach-O generation prototype
- Multiple discovery and analysis scripts demonstrating feasibility
