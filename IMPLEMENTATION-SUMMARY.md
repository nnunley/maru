# PEG Environment Isolation Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented dotted environment access syntax for PEG grammar isolation in Maru, addressing the user's requirements:

1. **PEG IR → S-expression compiler** with in-place instantiation
2. **Dotted environment access syntax** (`env.symbol`) similar to `self.field`
3. **Grammar environment isolation** to prevent rule name conflicts
4. **In-place parser instantiation** mechanism

## Implementation Files

### Core Infrastructure

#### `dotted-access-working.l` - Working Dotted Environment Access System
- **Character-to-string conversion**: Implemented lookup table for character codes since `string(char-code)` doesn't work in Maru
- **String parsing**: Manual character-by-character parsing to extract dotted symbols
- **Compile-time expansion**: Transforms `env.symbol` to `(working-env-lookup env 'symbol)`
- **Environment structure**: `<working-env>` with name and bindings
- **Macro system**: `with-working-env` for compile-time dotted symbol expansion

Key functions:
```lisp
(define-function split-at-dot-working (str))           ; Parse "env.x" → ("env" . "x")
(define-function parse-dotted-symbol-working (sym))    ; Handle symbol → parts
(define-function expand-dotted-working (expr env-map)) ; Compile-time expansion
(define-form with-working-env (env-bindings . body))   ; Context macro
```

#### `peg-grammar-environments.l` - PEG Grammar with Isolated Environments
- **Grammar structure**: `<peg-grammar>` with name, environment, and rules
- **PEG IR compiler**: Enhanced to transform rule references to use dotted access
- **Environment isolation**: Each grammar has its own isolated environment
- **Rule compilation**: Internal rule references transformed to `grammar.rule` format

Key functions:
```lisp
(define-function compile-peg-ir-with-env (ir env-name)) ; Enhanced PEG compiler
(define-function make-peg-grammar (name))               ; Create isolated grammar
(define-function peg-define-rule (grammar rule-name ir)) ; Define rule in grammar
```

#### `peg-boot-final.l` - Enhanced PEG Boot System
- **In-place parser instantiation**: `define-peg-parser` macro
- **Grammar definition**: Rules defined within parser definition
- **Environment integration**: Uses dotted access for rule isolation

Key macros:
```lisp
(define-form define-peg-parser (parser-name grammar-def start-rule))
```

## Technical Achievements

### 1. ✅ PEG IR → S-expression Compiler
- Transforms all PEG operations: `match-object`, `match-class`, `match-rule`, `match-string`, `match-range`
- Supports complex constructs: `match-sequence`, `match-or`, `match-star`, `match-plus`, `match-optional`
- Handles predicates: `match-and`, `match-not`
- **Environment-aware**: Rule references transformed to use dotted notation

### 2. ✅ Dotted Environment Access Syntax
- **Syntax**: `env.symbol` similar to existing `self.field`
- **Parsing**: Manual string splitting using character codes (works around missing string functions)
- **Expansion**: Compile-time transformation to environment lookups
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing Maru macro system

### 3. ✅ Grammar Environment Isolation
- **Isolated environments**: Each grammar maintains separate rule namespace
- **Rule references**: Internal rules use `grammar.rule` notation
- **No conflicts**: Multiple grammars can define rules with same names
- **Scoped access**: Rules only accessible within their grammar environment

### 4. ✅ In-place Parser Instantiation
- **Single-step definition**: Define parser with grammar rules in one macro call
- **No intermediate files**: Direct compilation from grammar definition
- **Environment creation**: Automatically creates isolated environment
- **Rule processing**: Processes rule definitions and creates parser function

### 5. ✅ Multiple Grammar Coexistence
- **Namespace isolation**: Each grammar has own rule environment
- **Same rule names**: Different grammars can use identical rule names without conflict
- **Independent compilation**: Grammars compile independently
- **Scoped references**: Rule references are environment-scoped

## Code Examples

### Basic Dotted Access
```lisp
(define test-env (make-working-env 'test))
(working-env-define test-env 'x 42)

;; Compile-time expansion
(with-working-env ((env . test-env))
  (+ env.x env.x))  ; → 84
```

### Isolated Grammar Creation
```lisp
(define js-grammar (make-peg-grammar 'js))
(peg-define-rule js-grammar 'letter '(match-class letter))
(peg-define-rule js-grammar 'identifier '(match-sequence (match-rule letter) (match-star (match-rule letter))))

;; Rules compiled with environment prefixes:
;; identifier → (SEQUENCE (RULE js.letter) (STAR (RULE js.letter)))
```

### In-place Parser Definition
```lisp
(define-peg-parser js-identifier-parser
  ((rule letter (match-class letter))
   (rule digit (match-class digit))
   (rule identifier (match-sequence (match-rule letter) (match-star (match-or (match-rule letter) (match-rule digit))))))
  identifier)

;; Creates parser with isolated environment automatically
```

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: PEG grammars shared global namespace, causing rule name conflicts when multiple grammars were defined.

**Solution**: Implemented dotted environment access that provides:
- Complete rule namespace isolation per grammar
- Compile-time expansion of dotted symbols
- Environment-scoped rule references
- In-place parser instantiation without intermediate files

**Result**: Multiple PEG grammars can now coexist with same rule names, each operating in its own isolated environment accessible via dotted notation.

## Technical Challenges Overcome

### 1. String Function Limitations
**Problem**: Maru lacks `string-find-char`, `substring`, and `string(char-code)` functions.
**Solution**: Implemented character-by-character parsing with lookup table for character conversion.

### 2. Compile-time Symbol Expansion
**Problem**: Need to expand `env.symbol` at compile time, similar to `self.field`.
**Solution**: Created `expand-dotted-working` function for AST transformation and `with-working-env` macro.

### 3. Environment Isolation
**Problem**: PEG rules were defined globally, causing conflicts.
**Solution**: Created `<peg-grammar>` structure with isolated environments and environment-aware rule compilation.

### 4. Rule Reference Transformation
**Problem**: Internal rule references needed to be environment-scoped.
**Solution**: Enhanced PEG IR compiler to transform rule references to use dotted notation (`grammar.rule`).

## Files Created

1. `dotted-access-working.l` - Working dotted environment access system
2. `peg-grammar-environments.l` - PEG grammars with isolated environments  
3. `peg-boot-final.l` - Enhanced PEG boot system with in-place parser instantiation
4. Supporting development files: `dotted-access-minimal.l`, `test-self-dot.l`, `debug-dotted.l`

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ PEG IR → S-expression compiler in peg-boot
- ✅ Generated peg-compile.l equivalent (peg-grammar-environments.l)
- ✅ Mechanism to instantiate parsers in-place
- ✅ Grammars inside their own environments
- ✅ Dotted environment access syntax implemented first (as requested)

The implementation provides a robust foundation for PEG grammar development in Maru with complete environment isolation and modern syntax features.
