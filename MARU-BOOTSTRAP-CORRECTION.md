# Correction: Multi-Methods Are Original Architecture

## Important Correction

I made a significant error in my analysis - **multi-method dispatch is NOT a later addition**. It's a core part of Ian Piumarta's original design, present in the very first bootstrap files.

## Evidence from Original `boot.l`

### 1. Selectors (Single Dispatch)
```lisp
;; From original boot.l lines ~400+
(define-structure <selector> (name methods default))
(define-form define-selector (name . default) ...)
(define-form define-method (selector type args . body) ...)
```

### 2. Multi-Methods (Multiple Dispatch)  
```lisp
;; From original boot.l lines ~661+
(define-structure <generic> (name methods default))
(define-form define-generic (name . default) ...)
(define-form define-multimethod (method typed-args . body) ...)
```

## Corrected Understanding

### **Original System Architecture** (Ian Piumarta)
The base bootstrap already includes:
- ✅ **Selectors**: Single dispatch on first argument type
- ✅ **Multi-methods**: Full multiple dispatch system
- ✅ **Generic functions**: `define-generic` + `define-multimethod`
- ✅ **Type-based dispatch**: Built into the core evaluation model

### **Current Emit System Issue**
The proliferation of 30+ emit variants (`emit-c-threaded-*.l`) suggests that the **existing multi-method system isn't being used effectively** for code generation, not that multi-methods are missing.

### **Design Implication**
Instead of "adding multi-method dispatch," the cleanup should **leverage the existing multi-method system** to consolidate the emit variants:

```lisp
;; Use original syntax from boot.l
(define-generic emit-code)

(define-multimethod emit-code ((<c-target> target) expr env)
  ;; C code generation
  )

(define-multimethod emit-code ((<ir-target> target) expr env)  
  ;; IR code generation
  )

(define-multimethod emit-code ((<jit-target> target) expr env)
  ;; JIT compilation
  )
```

## Corrected Bootstrap Levels

### Level 0: Original (Ian Piumarta Design)
- **Includes**: Multi-method dispatch system
- **Status**: Complete, elegant, functional
- **Issue**: Not being used to full potential

### Level 1: Enhanced UX  
- **Builds on**: Original multi-method foundation
- **Adds**: Better error messages, UTF-8, improved REPL
- **Preserves**: All original multi-method capabilities

### Level 2: Modern Features
- **Extends**: Original multi-method system  
- **Adds**: IR generation, FFI, JIT capabilities
- **Architecture**: Uses multi-methods for all dispatch

## Key Insight

The **original Maru design was already sophisticated** with full multi-method dispatch. The current codebase issues stem from **not using this existing architecture effectively**, rather than missing capabilities.

The cleanup should **embrace and leverage** the original multi-method design, not recreate it.

## Thank You for the Correction

This is an important correction that fundamentally changes the cleanup strategy from "adding missing features" to "properly using existing elegant architecture." The original Ian Piumarta design was more sophisticated than I initially recognized.
